									Commercial General Liability Coverage's
								</h2>
							</div>
							
							<div class="entry-content">
							<p>The Commercial General Liability Policy provides the insurance protection   needed to pay damages for bodily injury or property damages for which the   insured is legally responsible. The policy provides coverage for liability   arising from personal injury and advertising injury. Coverage for medical   expense is also provided. The policy also covers accidents occurring on the   premises or away from the premises. Coverage is provided for injury or damages   arising out of goods or products made or sold by the named insured. The insured   is the named insured and the employees of the named insured. However, several   individuals and organizations, other than the named insured, may be covered,   depending upon certain circumstances specified in the policy. In addition to the   limits, the policy provides supplemental payments for attorney fees, court costs   and other expenses associated with a claim or the defense of a liability   suit.</p>
			                <p>There are two commercial general liability coverage forms available, the   occurrence form and the claims-made form. Both forms are somewhat identical in   the coverages offered. The main difference is in the way claims are handled   under the two forms. The occurrence form covers bodily injury or property damage   claims that occur during the policy term, regardless of when the claim is   reported. The claims-made policy form only covers claims made against the   insured during the policy term. A claim made after the policy expires is not   covered by a claims-made policy unless the claim is covered by an extended   reporting period. The claims-made policy will only have the extended reporting   period. The following terms reflect both forms.</p>
			                <p><strong>General Aggregate</strong><BR>
			                  The General Aggregate Limit is the most money the   insurer will pay under a certain coverage for all claims occurring during the   policy term.</p>
			                <p><strong>Premises/Operations</strong><BR>
			                  Coverage is provided for damages arising out of   ownership or occupancy of the insured premises when not maintained in a   reasonable manner. This also covers damages arising out of operations performed   by the insured business.</p>
			                <p><strong>Products/Completed Operations</strong><BR>
			                  Products coverage is provided for   damages arising out of products manufactured, sold, handled or distributed by   the insured. Completed Operations covers damages occurring after operations have   been completed or abandoned, or after an item is installed or built and released   for it's intended purpose.</p>
			                <p><strong>Medical Expense Limit</strong><BR>
			                  Medical payments coverage pays medical   expenses resulting from bodily injury caused by an accident on premises owned or   rented by the insured, or locations next to such property, or when caused by the   insured's operations. These payments are made without regard to the liability of   the insured.</p>
			                <p><strong>Fire Damage Limit</strong><BR>
			                  The fire damage limit provides coverage for fire   damage caused by negligence on the part of the insured to premises rented to the   named insured. If a fire occurs because of negligence of the insured and causes   damage to property not rented to the insured, coverage would be provided under   the occurrence limit.</p>
			                <p><strong>Personal Injury</strong><BR>
			                  Personal Injury means injury other than bodily   injury. Coverage is provided for injury resulting from offenses such as false   arrest, malicious prosecution, detention or imprisonment, the wrongful entry   into, wrongful eviction from and other acts of invasion, or rights of private   occupancy of a room. Coverage for libel and slander is also provided in the   policy.</p>
			                <p><strong>Advertising Injury</strong><BR>
			                  This coverage pays for damages done in the   course of oral or written advertisement that disparages, libels or slanders a   person's or organization's goods, products or services. Coverage for these   offenses is provided under advertising injury coverage only if they occur during   the course of advertising the named insured's own goods, products or   services.</p>
			                <p><strong>Each Occurrence</strong><BR>
			                  Each occurrence is considered to be an accident,   which could include continuous or repeated exposure to the same harmful   conditions. An occurrence can also be a sudden event, or a result of a long term   series of events.</p>
			                <p><strong>Claims Made Form Only</strong></p>
			                <p><strong>Basic Extended Reporting Period (Basic Tail)</strong><BR>
			                  This coverage is   provided automatically without an additional premium charge if coverage is   canceled, not renewed, or the insurer renews with a later retroactive date. The   basic extended reporting period starts at the end of the policy period and last   for five years for claims made against the insured within the five year period   and reported to the insurer within 60 days after the end of the policy   period.</p>
			                <p><strong>Supplemental Extended Reporting Period (Supplemental Tail)</strong><BR>
			                  The   supplemental extended reporting period is available under the same circumstances   as the basic one. However, it becomes effective only if the named insured makes   a written request within 60 days after termination of the policy period and the   additional premium is paid. The supplemental extended reporting begins when the   basic one ends, and it continues forever. It cannot be canceled by the insured   or insurer. The supplemental tail endorsement would provide coverage for claims   reported to the insurer within sixty days after the end of the policy period but   did not result in a claim being made against the insured until after the end of   the five year policy period.</p>
			                <p>Other types of occurrence or offenses that are unknown by the insured and   therefore not reported within the sixty days after the end of the policy period   could also be covered by the supplemental tail. When the tail is purchased the   policies general aggregate limit and the products/completed operations aggregate   limit is reinstated.</p>
			                <p><strong>Retroactive Date</strong><BR>
			                The retroactive date shown in the policy   declarations is the same as the inception date, or the retroactive date can be a   date prior to the inception date. A policy can also be written with no   retroactive date.</p>
