									Commercial Property Coverage Outline

							<p>Property Insurance is any type of insurance that indemnifies an insured party   who suffers a financial loss because property has been damaged or destroyed.   Property is considered to be any item that has a value. Property can be   classified as real property or personal property. Real property is land and the   attachments to the land, such as buildings. Personal Property is all property   that is not real property. The Building and Personal Property coverage form is   the form used to insure almost all types of commercial property. The insuring   agreement in the Building and Personal Property coverage form promises to pay   for direct physical loss or damage to covered property at the premises described   in the policy when caused by or resulting from a covered cause of loss. The   following is a brief outline of coverage's and how they are used within the   Commercial Building And Personal Property coverage form.</p>
			                <p><strong>Buildings and Business Personal Property</strong><BR>
			                  Coverage for the building   includes the building and structures, completed additions to covered buildings,   outdoor fixtures, permanently installed fixtures, machinery and equipment. The   building material used to maintain and service the insured's premises is also   insured. Business Personal Property owned by the insured and used in the   insured's business is covered for direct loss or damage. The coverage includes   furniture and fixtures, stock, and several other similar business property items   when not specifically excluded from coverage. The policy is also designed to   protect the insured against loss or damage to the personal property of others   while in the insured's care, custody or control.</p>
			                <p><strong>Coverage Extensions and Additional Coverages</strong><BR>
			                  In addition to the   limits stated in the Building and Personal Property coverage form, the policy   has a coverage extensions section and an additional coverage's section. The   coverage extensions section provides limited coverage for newly acquired or   constructed property, property of others, certain outdoor property, and the cost   to research and reconstruct information on destroyed records. When coverage is   placed on the all risk form, two additional extensions are added for property in   transit and coverage for certain repair costs related to damage caused by water.   The two additional extensions are covered by certain perils only. The additional   coverage section provides coverage for indirect losses that result from a direct   loss. The coverage applies to removal of debris, preservation of property, fire   department service charges and pollutant cleanup and removal. The coverage   extensions and the additional coverage's have limitations and are subject to   certain conditions.</p>
			                <p><strong>Limit of Insurance</strong><BR>
			                  The most the insurer will pay for loss or damage   in any one occurrence is the limit of insurance stated in the policy   declarations.</p>
			                <p><strong>Deductible</strong><BR>
			                  The standard deductible is $250. However, other   deductible amounts are available and the deductible applies only once per   loss.</p>
			                <p><strong>Causes of Loss</strong><BR>
			                  The term peril is used when discussing losses. A   peril is a cause of loss. Basic property insurance policies are written to cover   the perils of fire, lightning, explosion, windstorm, hail, smoke, aircraft or   vehicle damage, riot or civil commotion, vandalism, sprinkler leakage, sinkhole   collapse, and volcanic action. Other property insurance policies, often referred   to as the broad form policy, add coverages for water damage, weight of snow, ice   or sleet, breakage of glass and coverage for falling objects. The broadest   coverage is the special form, which is best known as the all risk form. All risk   covers all causes of loss, except those specifically excluded from coverage. It   is possible for a commercial property policy to have more than one cause of loss   form.</p>
			                <p><strong>Replacement Cost and Actual Cash Value</strong><BR>
			                  Property can be valued in   several different ways. Insurance companies commonly use two approaches to   determine value, which also determines how a loss will be paid; the replacement   cost method and the actual cash value method. Insurers consider replacement cost   of a property item to be the cost to replace it with new property of like kind.   Actual cash value is replacement cost, minus the accumulated depreciation for   age and condition.</p>
			                <p><strong>Agreed Value</strong><BR>
			                  When the agreed value option is used the coinsurance   requirement is removed and the insurer agrees to cover loses for it's agreed   value. As an example, the insured has property insured for $100,000 and the   agreed value is also $100,000, if a loss occurs, any loss up to $100,000 is   covered at 100% When this option is used the insured and the insurance company   agree on the value of the property before the policy is issued. This option is   usually assigned to one-of-a-kind property.</p>
			                <p><strong>Coinsurance</strong><BR>
			                  Most building and business personal property polices   have a coinsurance clause which requires the insured to carry insurance equal to   at least a specified percentage of the actual cash value of the property. If a   loss occurs, and it is determined that the amount of insurance carried is less   than the amount required, a penalty could be placed on the insured.</p>
			                <p><strong>Inflation Guard</strong><BR>
			                  An insured can insure a building for its full value   at the beginning of the policy year, but, at the end of the year, it might not   be covered for it's full value. This problem can be corrected by adding   inflation guard coverage. With inflation guard, the policy limit increases   gradually during the policy term so that the total increase amounts to the   desired percentage increase at the end of the policy term.</p>
			                <p><strong>Earthquake Coverage</strong><BR>
			                This endorsement extends your cause of loss to   include damage that results directly from an earthquake. Coverage is provided   for replacement of buildings only. All earthquake shocks that occur within a 168   hour period (one week) are considered to be a single occurrence. A separate   deductible applies and is determined by the value of the insured property.</p>
